# A-Comprehensive-Approach-to-Designing-a-32-bit-ARM-CPU
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a 32-bit ARM-like CPU architecture, emphasizing efficient processing and scalability. The CPU is designed with an optimized instruction set and memory management, aiming to provide a robust platform for embedded applications and general-purpose computing
# CPUs Instruction set
Our designed CPU can handle the following commands.

Data Processing: ADD SUB AND ORR

Memory Operation: STR and LDR

Branch: B

Also, cover all the conditional mnemonics from ARM LRM, as shown in the snapshot below.
